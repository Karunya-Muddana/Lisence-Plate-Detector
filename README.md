# Lisence-Plate-Detector
This repository contains a Python script that detects and extracts vehicle license plates from images using OpenCV. It uses edge detection and contour approximation to locate rectangular regions likely to be license plates. The script displays the detected plate along with the original image with highlighted contours.
